They are a shorthand way of creating and working with lists. It is good to be aware of list comprehensions, because you will see them in other people's code, and they are really useful when you understand how to use them. That said, if they don't make sense to you yet, don't worry about using them right away. When you have worked with enough lists, you will want to use comprehensions. For now, it is good enough to know they exist, and to recognize them when you see them. If you like them, go ahead and start trying to use them now.\n",

    "Coding Style: PEP 8\n",
    "===\n",
    "You are now starting to write Python programs that have a little substance. Your programs are growing a little longer, and there is a little more structure to your programs. This is a really good time to consider your overall style in writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need style conventions?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The people who originally developed Python made some of their decisions based on the realization that code is read much more often than it is written. The original developers paid as much attention to making the language easy to read, as well as easy to write. Python has gained a lot of respect as a programming language because of how readable the code is. You have seen that Python uses indentation to show which lines in a program are grouped together. This makes the structure of your code visible to anyone who reads it. There are, however, some styling decisions we get to make as programmers that can make our programs more readable for ourselves, and for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several audiences to consider when you think about how readable your code is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yourself, 6 months from now\n",
    "- You know what you are thinking when you write code for the first time. But how easily will you recall what you were thinking when you come back to that code tomorrow, next week, or six months from now? We want our code to be as easy to read as possible six months from now, so we can jump back into our projects when we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other programmers you might want to collaborate with\n",
    "- Every significant project is the result of collaboration these days. If you stay in programming, you will work with others in jobs and in open source projects. If you write readable code with good commments, people will be happy to work with you in any setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential employers\n",
    "- Most people who hire programmers will ask to see some code you have written, and they will probably ask you to write some code during your interview. If you are in the habit of writing code that is easy to read, you will do well in these situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a PEP?\n",
    "---\n",
    "A PEP is a *Python Enhancement Proposal*. When people want to suggest changes to the actual Python language, someone drafts a Python Enhancement Proposal. One of the earliest PEPs was a collection of guidelines for writing code that is easy to read. It was PEP 8, the [Style Guide for Python Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). There is a lot in there that won't make sense to you for some time yet, but there are some suggestions that you should be aware of from the beginning. Starting with good style habits now will help you write clean code from the beginning, which will help you make sense of your code as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Python style guidelines\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Indentation\n",
    "- Use 4 spaces for indentation. This is enough space to give your code some visual structure, while leaving room for multiple indentation levels. There are configuration settings in most editors to automatically convert tabs to 4 spaces, and it is a good idea to check this setting. On Geany, this is under Edit>Preferences>Editor>Indentation; set Width to 4, and Type to *Spaces*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line Length\n",
    "- Use up to 79 characters per line of code, and 72 characters for comments. This is a style guideline that some people adhere to and others completely ignore. This used to relate to a limit on the display size of most monitors. Now almost every monitor is capable of showing much more than 80 characters per line. But we often work in terminals, which are not always high-resolution. We also like to have multiple code files open, next to each other. It turns out this is still a useful guideline to follow in most cases. There is a secondary guideline of sticking to 99 characters per line, if you want longer lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many editors have a setting that shows a vertical line that helps you keep your lines to a certain length. In Geany, you can find this setting under Edit>Preferences>Editor>Display. Make sure \"Long Line Marker\" is enabled, and set \"Column\" to 79.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Blank Lines\n",
    "- Use single blank lines to break up your code into meaningful blocks. You have seen this in many examples so far. You can use two blank lines in longer programs, but don't get excessive with blank lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments\n",
    "- Use a single space after the pound sign at the beginning of a line. If you are writing more than one paragraph, use an empty line with a pound sign between paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Variables\n",
    "- Name variables and program files using only lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers. Python won't complain or throw errors if you use capitalization, but you will mislead other programmers if you use capital letters in variables at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all for now. We will go over more style guidelines as we introduce more complicated programming structures. If you follow these guidelines for now, you will be well on your way to writing readable code that professionals will respect."
